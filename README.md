This repository contains the tasks I completed as part of a 30-day AI/ML Virtual Internship offered by Elevate Labs. Over the first 15 days, I worked through foundational hands-on assignments focusing on data analysis, preprocessing, and basic modeling using real-world datasets. Each task is organized into its own folder for clarity.

Elevate Internship – AI/ML Projects (Tasks 1–4)

 #Task 1 – Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
Explored raw Titanic dataset
Handled missing values, encoded categorical data
Scaled features and visualized outliers
Tools used: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn

 #Task 2 – Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Used visualizations like histograms, pairplots, and boxplots to explore relationships
Computed descriptive statistics
Identified data patterns and feature importance
Tools used: Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Plotly

 #Task 3 – Linear Regression
Applied simple and multiple linear regression models on house price data
Evaluated model using MAE, MSE, and R² score
Visualized regression line and interpreted coefficients
Tools used: scikit-learn, Pandas, Matplotlib

 #Task 4 – Logistic Regression
Built a binary classification model using the breast cancer dataset
Evaluated performance with confusion matrix, ROC-AUC, precision, recall
Understood sigmoid function and decision thresholds
Tools used: scikit-learn, Pandas, Matplotlib
